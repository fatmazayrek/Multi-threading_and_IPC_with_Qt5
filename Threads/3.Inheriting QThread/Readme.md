Hi friends:raising_hand_woman:

In this example, I did Widget application contains 2 Buttons, one Progressingbar, one Dial and one LCD:rose:

When you click the Start button, Thread starts the counting and progressing bar fulls with its LCD number. When the progressing bar is full then a MessageBox opens:rainbow:

When you click Start Dial button then Dial starts counting. 

This example also a good example about starting multithread at the same time:zap:

I hope, it helps your studies:teacher:
