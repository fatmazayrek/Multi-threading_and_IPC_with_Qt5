Hello everyone:relaxed:

In this example I created a simple Widget example.

I put 2 buttons and each button starts its own thread. When you clicked the _Start Count_ button LCD count down or when you click the _Start Timer_ Timer starts counting:dizzy:

I hope, this example can help your studies:see_no_evil:
