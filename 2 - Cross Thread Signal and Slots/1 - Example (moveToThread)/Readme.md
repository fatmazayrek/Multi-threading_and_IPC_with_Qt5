Hi everyone:rosette:

In this example I did a simple Widget example which contains a PushButton and TextEdit. This example shows you how to use signal and slots cross Threads:seedling:

When you click this button signal send the datas to thread which contains _Receiver_ object:fallen_leaf:

If you click more than 9, then thread is killed:no_entry:

I hope, it helps your studies:shamrock:
