Hi everyone😇

In this Project, I did a simple Message Application using UDP Socket🌐

When you click the Connect Button on the Receiver, UDP Socket opens with written port number. When you click the Send Button on the Sender, message from the LineEdit sends to Receiver Socket which has same port number with the Sender Socket📲

I hope all is clear🌈

Good Luck🤓
