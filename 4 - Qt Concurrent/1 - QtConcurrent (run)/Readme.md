Hi everyone:nazar_amulet:	

In this example, I simply showed you how to use QtConcurrent::run() method :next_track_button:	

Before using the QtConcurrent, you must add **QT += concurrent** into the .pro file :arrow_forward:

In this Wisget application, I added 4 Buttons: Start, Stop, Resume and Cancal. These buttons are useless except the Start button.:no_entry:

Because when you click the _Start_ button, future starts:bangbang: 

I hope, it helps your studies:white_check_mark:
