Hi everyone 🏚️

In this example, I showed you how to use QSharedMemory using QBuffer, QDataStream and QFileDialog💫

This application contains 2 Buttons and 1 Label👌

When you click the *Select* Button you must choose an Image from file✅

When you click the *Load* button in the another Process application, this Image load from Shared memory⏸️

THis method is not recommended⛔

I hope, it benefits your studies😊
