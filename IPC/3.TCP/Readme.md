Hi everyone😊

In this example, I did a simple Chat application using QTcpSocket and QTcpServer⏸️

THis example contains base functions of the socket class🌞

Client application waits certain time. If there is a connection during this time, client connects.  Otherwise, a messagebox opens✅

I hope it helps your studies💫
