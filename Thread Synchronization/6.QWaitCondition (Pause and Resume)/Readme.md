Hi everyone:relaxed:

In this example, I did a simple Widget application:high_brightness:

In this application, there are interconnected 2 Threads. One thread starts the LCD secreen. When the number on the LCD secreen is 15, then second thread starts the ProgressBar.

I added also 3 Buttons: 
_Click to Start_: When you click this button, threads starts:checkered_flag: 
_Pause_: When you click this button, ProgressBar stops:red_square:
_Resume_: When you click this button, ProgressBar continue:green_square:

*NOT*: This example also a good example about signal/slots between threads:triangular_flag_on_post:
