Hi everyone:hand:

In this example, I showed you how Threads can share a Class with simple QWidget application

In this Widget there are 2 Threads whose share a common increment function of a Class. 

When you **Click** the button, two threads start. But Ä±f you don't use a QMutex, these 2 Threads starts simultaneously:anger: 

I used a QMutexLocker in this example so, one threads wait for other thread:point_right
